Around April 2002, our Sliders group published Diskmag Exilium issue 1 on our own FTP.<br>
Subsequently, several members of the demoscene published it on <b>pouet.net</b> and <b>scene.org</b>.

This diskmag was multiplatform (DOS, Windows, Linux, Beos and QNX). It had several other engines, like BSD and PSX, but in the end, it was released for those 5.<br>
The editor and coder of it is me (JJ, ackerman).<br>

After so many years, I am releasing the code, so that it can be looked at in an educational way or whatever you want, given that it is of little use today.<br>

If you just want to run, the data (sliders1.dat) was in the MSDOS distribution, having to copy the binaries for each OS to the same location.
